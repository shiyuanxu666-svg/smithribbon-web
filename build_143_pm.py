     "Forward, IKEA Climate Positive, H&M Conscious, Inditex Join Life, Costco Sustainability, "
     "Marks & Spencer Plan A, Lidl / Schwarz, Kroger Zero Hunger Zero Waste) now score suppliers on "

     "Product Passport (DPP) regulation requires third-party verified lab-test reports for every "
     "textile-trim SKU imported into the EU starting 2027, with a transitional period in 2026. "
     "Third, the US-CPSC and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) "
     "Prop 65 enforcement now requires lab-test evidence per shipment, not per program. Fourth, "
     "brand-side ESG reporting (CSRD, SASB, TCFD) treats the lab-accreditation scope as a board-level "
     "metric. A 2026 B2B ribbon OEM program that runs the 143-module architecture compresses "

     "third-party lab-test cycle to 5 to 9 business days. Stage 1 = sample-pull from production lot. "
     "Stage 2 = sample-identification (SKU, lot ID, color, fiber). Stage 3 = sample-conditioning "
